## Improvements

This is the improved website for Horiseon Marketing Agency. Some changes I made:
- Improved the rendering speed of the main image
- Added semantic elements and organized HTML
- Added box-shadow and border-radius properties to boxes to make them more aesthetically-pleasing
- Fixed any broken links in the navigation
- Added alt attribute to images to increase accessibility
- Added a concise, decriptive title to tab
